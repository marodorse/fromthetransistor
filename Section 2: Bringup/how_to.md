# Comfy HDL Design setup

- The language: systemVerilog
- The simulator: Verilator
- The visualizer: GTKWave

## How to code - simulate - visualize?

### Code

First step is to write your design.

Simple example:

```systemverilog

```

Then you write your testbench[¹](#glossary), to provide input to your DUT/UUT[²](#glossary).

Simple example:

```systemverilog

```

### Simulate



### Visualize

- Go into GTKWave.
- Make new tab with your .vcd file.
- Select all your signals in the left column.
- Analyze and enjoy! :D

### Glossary

1. The function of a testbench is to apply stimulus (inputs) to the DUT/UUT, and report the outputs in a readable and user-friendly format.

2. Device Under Test | Unit Under Test.
