# Running on real hardware (1 week)

- [ ] **Talking to an FPGA(C, 200)**
    - *A little code for the USB MCU to bitbang JTAG.*
- [ ] **Building an FPGA board**
    - *Board design, FPGA BGA reflow, FPGA flash, a 50mhz clock, a USB JTAG port and flasher(no special hardware, a little cypress usb mcu to do jtag), a few leds, a reset button, a serial port(USB-FTDI) also powering via USB, an sd card, expansion connector(ide cable?), and an ethernet port. Optional, expansion board, host USB port, NTSC TV out, an ISA port, and PS/2 connector on the board to taunt you. We provide a toaster oven and a multimeter thermometer to do reflow.*
- [ ] **Bringup**
    - *Compiling and downloading the Verilog for the board*
