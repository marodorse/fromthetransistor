# Cheatsheet

This is gonna be a spot where I can freely put terms that I don't understand yet, and translate their *ROBOT* definition to something comprehensive for a novice such as myself.

Anything that I don't understand, I will just put here to have something to assist me while reading through stuff that is currently too complex for me.\
If it looks like it's a prerequitite in the course that I DON'T have then it will be here!
