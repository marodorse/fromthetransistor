# Notes

## Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors, and that ICs are just collections of transistors in a nice reliable package.

### Question 1 - What the fuck are transistors?

They're the main building block of electronics.\
They're a *semiconductor*[¹](#glossary)  device and there are two general types:

- Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)

    - Has three *separately doped regions*[²](#glossary) & two *junctions*[³](#glossary) 
    
    - Comes in **2** different types:
        - The ***npn***  BJT
        - The ***pnp***  BJT
        
    - Has **3** terminals:
        - Base ()
        - Collector (Positive lead)
        - Emitter (Negative lead)
    
- Field Effect Transistor (FET)

## Glossary

1. **Semiconductors** are called that way because solid materials are categorized in two ways, they can either be `insulating` or `metallic`. Which basically stands as a proxy for `bad` or `good` at conducting current.\
Now you have some insulators that are better conductors than others, and that is why they're called ***semi***conductors.\
In metals the electrons aren't really bound to atomic nuclei, so a small amount of energy can push them easily.\
In insulators the electrons are fully bound to their nuclei so it takes a lot of energy to rip them away.\
In semiconductors they're still bound to the nuclei but they have some space to move as they please.

2. **doping** is something that allows us to make the number of free electrons go up (Phosphorous) or down (Boron)!\
Silicon doped with Phosphorous is called N-type and doped with Boron is called P-type (Because their outer atomic shells are more Negative or Positive).

3. **junctions** are boundaries between the n and the p regions. They may be forward or reverse biased.
