# Cheating our way past the transistor (0.5 weeks)

## Objective(s)

- [ ] Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors, and that ICs are just collections of transistors in a nice reliable package. 
- [ ] Understand the LUTs and stuff. 
- [ ] Talk briefly about the theory of transistors, but all projects must build on each other so we canâ€™t build one.

*Emulation -- Building on real hardware limits the reach of this course. Using something like Verilator will allow anyone with a computer to play.*
